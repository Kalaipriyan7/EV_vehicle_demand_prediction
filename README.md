# EV Adoption Forecasting

## Overview

As electric vehicle (EV) adoption accelerates, forecasting trends in EV registrations is critical for infrastructure planning, especially the deployment of charging stations. This project aims to predict the future growth of EVs using a dataset from the Washington State Department of Licensing.

## Problem Statement

Using historical vehicle registration data, build a regression model to forecast electric vehicle (EV) adoption across different counties and vehicle types. The model should help estimate future demand for electric vehicles, aiding urban planning and sustainability efforts.

## Dataset Description

* **Source**: [Kaggle - Electric Vehicle Population Size 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahirmaharajj/electric-vehicle-population-size-2024/data)
* **Timeframe**: January 2017 to February 2024
* **Granularity**: Monthly data by county
* **Attributes**:

  * `Date`
  * `County`
  * `State`
  * `Vehicle Primary Use` (Passenger/Truck)
  * `Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)`
  * `Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)`
  * `Electric Vehicle (EV) Total`
  * `Non-Electric Vehicle Total`
  * `Total Vehicles`
  * `Percent Electric Vehicles`

## Project Goals

* Explore trends in EV registrations across time and regions
* Clean and preprocess raw vehicle registration data
* Train a machine learning regression model to predict future EV adoption
* Evaluate and validate the model using performance metrics

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* pandas, numpy
* matplotlib, seaborn
* scikit-learn
* joblib

## Steps Performed

### 1. Data Exploration

* Loaded and displayed the dataset
* Checked for missing values and data types
* Identified outliers using the IQR method

### 2. Data Preprocessing

* Converted `Date` column to `datetime` type
* Filled missing values in `County` and `State` with `"Unknown"`
* Removed or capped outliers in `Percent Electric Vehicles`
* Ensured consistency in numeric columns

### 3. Modeling (Planned in Next Phase)

* Encode categorical features
* Convert numeric strings (e.g., values with commas)
* Create time-based features (year, month)
* Fit a regression model such as `RandomForestRegressor`
* Evaluate using MAE, RMSE, and R² metrics
* Forecast EV totals for future months or years

## Future Improvements

* Time series forecasting using models like Prophet or ARIMA
* Incorporate external factors (fuel prices, policy changes)
* Add geospatial analysis and interactive visualizations
