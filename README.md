# EV Vehicle Demand Prediction

## Overview

Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly popular, and it is important to anticipate their future demand to support proper infrastructure planning—especially for charging stations. This project uses historical vehicle registration data to forecast EV adoption trends using machine learning techniques.

## Problem Statement

Build a regression model that can predict future demand for electric vehicles based on historical data. The predictions will help inform planning decisions at state and county levels.

## Dataset

* **Source**: [Kaggle - Electric Vehicle Population Size 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahirmaharajj/electric-vehicle-population-size-2024/data)
* **Time Range**: January 2017 – February 2024
* **Collected By**: Washington State Department of Licensing
* **Granularity**: Monthly, by county
* **Key Features**:

  * Date
  * County
  * State
  * Vehicle Primary Use (Passenger or Truck)
  * Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)
  * Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)
  * Electric Vehicle (EV) Total
  * Non-Electric Vehicle Total
  * Total Vehicles
  * Percent Electric Vehicles

## Project Objectives

* Analyze and preprocess the EV registration dataset
* Detect and handle missing values and outliers
* Train a regression model (Random Forest) to forecast EV totals
* Evaluate model performance using standard metrics
* Prepare data for use in future prediction tasks

## Tools and Libraries

* Python 3.x
* pandas, numpy
* matplotlib, seaborn
* scikit-learn
* joblib

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Exploration

* Loaded the dataset and reviewed the structure
* Checked data types and missing values
* Identified and treated outliers in the `Percent Electric Vehicles` column

### 2. Data Preprocessing

* Converted `Date` column to datetime format
* Replaced missing values in `County` and `State` with `"Unknown"`
* Converted object-type numeric columns to integers
* Capped outliers using interquartile range (IQR) method

### 3. Feature Engineering (Next Step)

* Extract year and month from date
* Encode categorical variables
* Select relevant features for modeling

### 4. Model Development (Planned)

* Use `RandomForestRegressor` for forecasting
* Split data into training and testing sets
* Evaluate using MAE, RMSE, and R²

## Future Enhancements

* Time series forecasting (Prophet, ARIMA)
* Incorporate EV charging station data
* Integrate external variables like fuel prices and EV incentives
* Visualize trends through dashboards
